# PyNeuNet

Initiall started as a Pythonic version of <a href = "http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/">"Hacker's guide to Neural Networks"</a> by <a href = "http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/">Andrej Karpathy</a>.
<br>
Motivated me to build a Library to learn and code neural networks for deep learning.
<br>
There are plenty of amazing libraries out there But, I felt there is a strong need for beginners to really understand
neural networks well, before they dive deep into Deep Learning. Afterall, not everything is a Black-box.
<br>
Reagarding the library, I wish to create just single layer of abstraction.
The library is intended to be easy-to-use and easy-to-understand.

<br>Demo -- comming soon.
